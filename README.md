üçå Gorillas Gone Bananas üçå

Welcome to Gorillas Gone Bananas, a modern twist on the classic artillery game! Perched atop destructible, randomly generated skyscrapers, two gorillas battle it out by hurling explosive bananas at each other. This game is a tribute to the original QBasic classic, rebuilt in HTML5 Canvas with a host of new features and animations.

‚ú® Features

Classic Artillery Gameplay: A simple yet deeply strategic turn-based battle.

Dynamic Animations: Gorillas taunt each other, celebrate victories, show a throwing motion, and fall dramatically when defeated.

Destructible Environment: Explosions create craters in the cityscape.

Interactive Sky: The sun reacts when hit, and clouds drift peacefully in the background.

Analog Flip-Clock Scoreboard: A retro-styled scoreboard that animates with each point.

Adjustable Gravity: A "Planet Selector" knob lets you change the gravity to match celestial bodies from the Moon to Jupiter, completely altering the game's physics.

Multiple Difficulty Levels: A full range of difficulty options to suit any player.

üéÆ How to Play

The objective is simple: be the first player to hit your opponent with a banana 3 times to win the match!

Mouse Controls (Baby, Easy, Medium, Hard)

When it's your turn, click and drag the mouse away from your gorilla to aim.

The further you drag, the more velocity your throw will have.

The angle of your drag determines the angle of the throw.

Release the mouse button to hurl your banana!

Use the Planet Selector to change the gravity and the Difficulty Slider to adjust the challenge.

Keyboard Controls (Old-School Difficulty)

When "Old-School" is selected, the mouse aiming is disabled.

Type your desired Angle (0-180) and Velocity into the input boxes.

Click the FIRE! button to launch your banana.

Levels of Difficulty

Easy: Shows a shorter, partial arc of the banana's path. Also displays your previous turn's angle and velocity.

Medium: Shows only a straight line pointing from your gorilla to your cursor.

Hard: Provides no aiming assistance at all. Pure skill!

Have fun, and may the best gorilla win!
